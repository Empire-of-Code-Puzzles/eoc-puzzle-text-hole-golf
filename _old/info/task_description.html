    If you want to play golf on the pages of a book, then first you need to find the plot holes. Let's do it.

</p>

<p>
    You are given a chunk of text as a sequence of strings. If we place them in columns in the order of how they are
    given, then we get an 2D array with various row lengths. A plot hole is a single white-space surrounded by letters,
    digits or punctuation symbols - up, down, left, right and diagonally. Two or more spaces do not constitute a plot
    hole. All "outer" characters a consider white-spaces, so a space on the outside cannot be considered a plot hole.
    Your goal is count the number of plot holes in the given text.
</p>
<p>
    Let's look an example:
<pre style="font-weight: bold">
How are you doing?
I'm fine. OK.
Lorem Ipsum?
Of course!!!
1234567890
0        0
1234567890
Fine! good buy!
</pre>
<br>
Here we can find three plot holes: before "OK"; between "Lorem" and "Ipsum"; inside "Of course!!!".
</p>


<p>
    In this mission the main goal to make your code as short as possible. The shorter your code, the more points you
    earn. Your score for this mission is dynamic and directly related to the length of your code. For reference, scoring
    is based on the number of characters used. 350 characters is the maximum allowable and it will earn you zero points.
    For each character less than 350, you earn 1 point. For example for 300 character long code earns you 50 points.
</p>

<p>
    <strong>Input: </strong> A text as a list of strings (unicode for py2).
</p>

<p>
    <strong>Output: </strong> The number of single holes as an integer.
